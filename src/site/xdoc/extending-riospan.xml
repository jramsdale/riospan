                    To get an idea of how to deploy RioSpan-based services with Rio, please check out the

                    Infinispan is typically configured via an XML configuration file that describes a cluster and the
                    caches it hosts. The RioSpan examples load their respective Infinispan configurations from a file
                    called
                    <code>infinispan-config.xml</code>
                    in the classpath of their service modules. Experienced Maven users would know to look for
                    classpath
                    resources in the
                    <code>src/main/resources</code>
                    directory within the example modules with a
                    <code>-service</code>
                    suffix.

                <p>In accordance with Rio practices, RioSpan is built as a multi-module Maven project. As Rio is built
                    on Jini, some understanding of Jini's approach to distributed services can be helpful in
                    understanding the relationships between the Maven modules.

                <p>Rio is configured with a configuration file called an opstring. Infinispan also has its own
                    configuration file structure. RioSpan essentially provides the ability to declare a Rio opstring
                    that deploys an Infinispan cluster of members to a Rio Cybernode cluster.
