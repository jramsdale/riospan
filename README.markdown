# RioSpan #

RioSpan is an experiment in deploying [Infinispan](http://www.infinispan.org "The Infinispan project page") to [Rio](http://rio-project.org "The Rio project page").

Why might this be of interest? To Infinispan's data-grid capabilities such as partitioned, replicated, key-value store, Hibernate 2nd-level cache, and Lucene Directory implementations Rio contributes dynamic service deployment and scaling. The combination could prove to be an extremely powerful, flexible, and dynamic distributed in-memory data store.
